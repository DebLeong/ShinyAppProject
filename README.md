## Deborah Leong - Shiny App Project
### Date: May 11, 2020

## Purpose

In this Shiny application, we're going to explore crunchbase data on startup investments from 1999 to 2013 in the United States.

Under the impact of COVID-19, paradigms are shifting and there are monumental business opportunities across 4 major industries:

1. Brick-and-Mortor Retail

2. Restaurants & Dining

3. Commercial Real Estate & Offices

4. Education


We seek to identify **Entrepreneurial Opportunities** post-COVID by analysing historical crunchbase data and startup activities in the last recession between 2007-2009 in the United States.
